**Boxlib - A PROS template created by an idiot, for idiots.**

- Created by 5327V

This library was inspired by popular libraries like [EZ-Template]([url](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template)) and [Lemlib]([url](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/releases/tag/v0.4.7)). We aim to create the simplest and most user-friendly library while maintaining functionality that is comparable to other libraries. 

**Features:**
1. Linear and angular motion PIDs
2. No tracking wheel odometry
3. move-to-point algorithm
